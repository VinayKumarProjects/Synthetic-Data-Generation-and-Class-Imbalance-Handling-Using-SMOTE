#  Synthetic Data Generation and Class Imbalance Handling Using SMOTE

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in a diabetes prediction dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training with Logistic Regression, and performance comparison before and after applying SMOTE.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset (`diabetes_data.csv`) contains 768 rows and 9 columns:

| Feature                  | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pregnancies              | Number of times pregnant                         |
| Glucose                  | Plasma glucose concentration                     |
| BloodPressure            | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)                |
| SkinThickness            | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)                 |
| Insulin                  | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)                  |
| BMI                      | Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes pedigree function                      |
| Age                      | Age (years)                                     |
| Outcome                  | Class variable (0 or 1, where 1 indicates diabetes) |

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

##  Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Ensure `diabetes_data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

##  Usage

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Load and inspect dataset structure
- Analyze class distribution for imbalance

###  Data Preprocessing
- Split dataset into training and testing sets
- Prepare features and target variables

###  SMOTE Application
- Apply SMOTE to training data to generate synthetic samples for the minority class

###  Model Training and Evaluation
- Train Logistic Regression models on original and SMOTE-augmented data
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC, and classification reports
- Compare performance using ROC curves

###  Visualization
- Generate ROC curve plots to compare model performance

##  Results

- **Class Imbalance**: Fewer instances of diabetes (Outcome = 1) than non-diabetes (Outcome = 0)
- **Model Performance**:
  - Original data: ROC-AUC between 0.7 and 0.8
  - SMOTE-augmented data: ROC-AUC between 0.8 and 0.9
- **Key Insight**: SMOTE improves model sensitivity and specificity by balancing class distribution
